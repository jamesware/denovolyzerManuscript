The manuscript is authored in rmarkdown, and output as a word .docx file  
template.docx is a template for document formatting  
denovolyzerManuscriptReferences is an endnote library containing necessary references to format the bibliography in word after it is compiled by R.  

(in subsequent manuscripts authored in `R` we have moved to the `knitcitations` package: an open source and more readily reproducible option. This also uses flat file formats that play more nicely with git version control)
